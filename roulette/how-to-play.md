Playing the game is pretty much as simple as it gets! Users will first ensure to get on the correct network (Ethereum | ChainID 1) in their wallet app such as Metamask, Trustwallet, Safepal etc. If unsure, head over to [HERE](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/8381031270301-How-to-add-a-custom-network-to-MetaMask?docs=true) and follow the steps.

Once network is added, head over to Ronin Casino dApp at [https://roningames.online](https://roningames.online) and connect your wallet, once connected, ensure that you also have enough Ethereum native coin in your wallet to pay for gas and txn fees.
