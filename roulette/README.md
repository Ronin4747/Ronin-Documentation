Traditional roulette, with its intricate rules and betting options, can be daunting for many players. At Ronin, we've taken a different approach. To streamline the game and optimize the playing experience, we've pared down choices to a simple "odd" or "even" bet, offering players a straightforward 50% chance of winning. This not only curtails the gas fees associated with more complex betting systems but also heightens the probability of success.

Our innovative adaptation ensures reduced network costs and a boosted win rate, aiming to keep players engaged and reduce discouragement from consecutive losses.
