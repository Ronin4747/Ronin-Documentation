Setting up for gameplay at Ronin Casino is a breeze! Begin by ensuring your wallet app, whether it's Metamask, Trustwallet, Safepal, or others, is configured to the right network - specifically, the Ethereum network with ChainID 1. If you're uncertain about the setup, follow the instructions provided [HERE](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/8381031270301-How-to-add-a-custom-network-to-MetaMask?docs=true)

Next, visit the Ronin Casino dApp at [https://roningames.online](https://roningames.online/) and sync your wallet. Before diving into the games, double-check that you have sufficient Ethereum native coin reserves to cover transaction and gas fees.&#x20;

And remember, while traditional casinos use unique identity chips for gameplay, Ronin Casino, being decentralized, necessitates the use of Ronin tokens. Conveniently swap your ETH or other tokens for Ronin tokens on our dApp's swap page, and you're ready to immerse yourself in the gaming experience!
